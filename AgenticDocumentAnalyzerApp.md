#### How I Built an Agentic Document Analyzer App
--------------------------------------------------

Imagine you need to analyze documents such as:

* Purchase Orders
* Supplier Invoices
* Shipping Documents
* Bank Statements
* Medical Reports

If those documents come from different suppliers, banks, or organizations across different countries, they rarely share the same format.

In reality:

* Different labels may represent the same business concept, such as **"Invoice No."**, **"Inv #"**, or **"Reference No."**
* Information may appear in one table, multiple tables, or even outside tables.
* Some values are written directly, while others use scaling notes such as **25 × 10⁻⁴** instead of **0.0025**.
* Important information may be located in headers, footers, barcodes, notes, or across multiple pages.

Although the business meaning is the same, the layout, terminology, and data presentation can be completely different.

Manually processing these documents is slow and error-prone. General-purpose AI models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are powerful, but they are trained on broad knowledge rather than the specific document structures and terminology used in your business.

This is where an **Agentic Document Analyzer** becomes valuable. By combining specialized AI components, it can consistently extract, normalize, map, and verify information across highly inconsistent document formats.

In this article, I'll share how I built this system and the ideas behind its architecture.
